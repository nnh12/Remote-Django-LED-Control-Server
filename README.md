# Remote Django LED Control Server
Built a smart lamp that is integrated with a website hosted on a Cloud AWS EC2 instance server and a touch screen display. Has function to adjust brightness, saturation, and on/off. 

Everything is connected to Rasyberry Pi 4 that controls the LED driver that powers the lamp

Web UI is interconnected with Touch Display. If user changes brightness on Web ui, the touch screen display will simultaneously change. Messages are sent over MQTT. 
Worked with another partner for this project.
