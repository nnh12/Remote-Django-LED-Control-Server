# Smart_Lamp
Created a smart lamp that is powered by a LED driver to display a desired color.. Programmed a Rasyberry Pi Micocontroller connected to a Touch Displayer. Programmed the touch display UI to control the LED drivers. Touch display UI is also connected to a Web UI hosted on a AWS EC2 Cloud Web Server. Web UI can control the LED.
